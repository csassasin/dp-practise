## Dynamic Programming

### Problem : Minimum Cost to Merge Stones
There are n piles of stones arranged in a row. The ith pile has stones[i] stones.

A move consists of merging exactly k consecutive piles into one pile, and the cost of this move is equal to the total number of stones in these k piles.

Return the minimum cost to merge all piles of stones into one pile. If it is impossible, return -1.

### Solution Explanation
This problem is amongst one of the harder problems in dynamic programming . It took me too long to understand the core concepts that lies behind such problems and before this I usually failed to visualise how I could reach to sub-problems in case I want to apply Dynamic-Programming to such problems .
